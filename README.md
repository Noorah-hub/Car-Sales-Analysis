# Car-Sales-Analysis
In the spirit of refreshing my data analysis skillset after a break, I worked on a car sales analysis project using a dataset gotten from Kaggle.
I then created a problem statement whereby I was hired as a data analyst to figure out how to improve the sales. 
Using python I analyzed the features and how it relates to the sales and gained insights.

Then I imported to excel before proceeding to power bi to build a dashboard.

Recommendations were duly noted and documented in the notebook.
